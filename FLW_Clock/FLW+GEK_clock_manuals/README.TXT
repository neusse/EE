PicBasic Pro Compiler 2.44,  Copyright (c) 2003 microEngineering Labs, Inc.

The PicBasic Pro Compiler files are compressed into the self-extracting
file PBP244.EXE on this disk.  They must be uncompressed before use.

To uncompress the files, create a directory on your hard drive called
PBP, or another name of your choosing:

        md PBP

Change to this directory:

        cd PBP

Assuming the distribution diskette is in drive a:, uncompress the files
into the PBP subdirectory:

        a:\pbp244 -d

Don't forget the -d option on the end of the command.  This ensures
that the proper subdirectories within PBP are created.

Alternatively, INSTALL.BAT can be run to perform similar steps.  If the
PBP directory already exists, you will get an error message and the
installation will continue.

All of the necessary files will be installed.  The uncompressed
READ.ME file has the latest information about the PicBasic Pro Compiler.
