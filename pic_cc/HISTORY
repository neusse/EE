A little bit of history about this small C compiler:

1979 :	the original Small C compiler by Ron Cain
	Targets: unknown.
	Compiles itself?

1980 :	Version 2 - published in Dr. Dobbs May 1980.

1986 :	Version 3 - modified and extended by Chris Lewis.
	Targets: 6809, 68000, 8080, VAX.
	Compiles itself.
	Source size: around 150Kb

1995 :	PIC code generator by John Favata <favata@cs.buffalo.edu>
	Target: Parallax PIC assembler (pseudo 8051 syntax)

1996 :	Ken Yap <ken@syd.dit.csiro.au> writes a code generator for Z80.
	Puts together a nice package with linker, optimizer, etc...

1997 :	Favata's code generator modified by Ian Stedman <ICStedman@techie.com>
	Unfinished, unfortunately.
	Target: Microchip PIC assembler

1998 :	New PIC code generator by Andrew D. Balsa <andrebalsa@altern.org>
	All changes are aimed at making this package usable under GNU/Linux 
	(but note that this is still WIP).
	Target: Microchip PIC assembler i.e. picasm 1.06 by Timo Rossi.
	pic_cc should compile OK under gcc, and produce reasonable assembler
	code for the files under /tests.
