Links and GNU/GPL PIC tools</H1>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>One can find almost every single piece of software needed for PIC development
on the Web.

<P>Obviously the reference site for PIC resources is the <A HREF="http://www.microchip.com">Microchip
Web site</A>. Besides the data sheets for the various PIC MCUs and Microchip
EEPROM memories, there is a nice assortment of Application Notes.

<P>An excellent unofficial site is <A HREF="david.tait@man.ac.uk">David
Tait</A>'s <A HREF="http://www.man.ac.uk/~mbhstdj">PIC pages</A>, with
links to many PIC projects and resources.

<P>Finally, a good starting point for free (in the GNU/GPL sense) PIC tools
is the <A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/jamesb/gnupic/">GNUPIC page</A>,
originally by <A HREF="mailto:rdmiller@execpc.com">Rick Miller</A> and
now maintained by <A HREF="mailto:jamesb@sgi.com">James Bowman</A>.

<P><B>PCB work</B>: for the simple printed circuits usually associated
with PIC based projects, I have found that the X Window package Pcb-1.5.5
(by Thomas Nau and Harry Eaton) is quite usable. Less than an hour after
compiling it, I was drawing my first PIC PCB! Available from the various
Linux sunsite.unc.edu mirrors.

<P><B>Schematics</B>: unfortunately I have not found any user-friendly
package for GNU/Linux yet. I guess KIllustrator will be a good candidate
in the future, with an adequate symbol library.

<P><B>PIC Assembler</B>: I am using <A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/trossi/pic">picasm
1.06</A> by <A HREF="mailto:trossi@iki.fi">Timo Rossi</A>. IMHO this is
production quality software, stable, fast and adequately documented. Another
very promising Assembler package is gpasm (now in version 0.0.6) by James
Bowman&nbsp; (see links above). It has two important advantages over picasm:
it is licensed under GNU/GPL and it follows more closely the MPASM syntax.

<P><B>Simulator</B>: I have found that xnitpic, by Dave Madden, is a very
nice package. Unfortunately it was not at all maintained during the last
four years. I just fixed some small bugs and patched it to read standard
INHX8M files instead of the old non-standard .pt format used initially
by Ian King. I am sending this updated version of xnitpic to James Bowman,
so check for it on the <A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/jamesb/gnupic/">GNUPIC</A>
page.

<P><B>Source code editor</B>: a huge choice. Emacs is by far the best tool,
if you can overcome the steep learning curve. I use Joe for short pieces
of code.

<P><B>PIC programmer</B>: a very nice package for GNU/Linux, called <A HREF="http://www.iki.fi/hyvatti/">Picprog
1.0</A>, was put together by <A HREF="mailto:Jaakko.Hyvatti@iki.fi">Jaakko
Hyvatti</A>. The hardware is based on an earlier design by Jens Madsen,
but the Linux software also works fine (without any modifications) with
<A HREF="http://www.gbar.dtu.dk/~c888600/newpic.htm">Jens' newest programmer
design</A>. This one uses two general purpose NPN transistors (the earlier
design used by Jaako has a single NPN transistor), two zener diodes and
a few passive components, which can all be put together in one or two hours
on a prototype board. It connects to the serial (RS-232) port of any Linux
box.

<P>This new programmer circuit is 100% safe for the PIC device being programmed,
and is guaranteed to program the EEPROM cells with adequate data retention.
Another advantage is that no external power supply is needed, as is the
case with parallel port programmers. Just plug it in, launch the command
line picprog utility and a few seconds later, you have your PIC ready for
work!

<P>BTW, I added the extra diode recommended by Jaako to Jens' newest programmer
circuit.

<P><B>C Compiler</B>: I have just put the finishing touches on the Alpha
0.4 version of a Small C compiler for PIC processors, which outputs assembler
code with standard Microchip mnemonics; this is derived from John Favata's
earlier work. I am sending the package to James Bowman and will also try
to upload it to the sunsite.unc.edu GNU/Linux archive.

<P>Right now this compiler has various limitations that may or may not
matter for specific projects. For small, simple PIC projects it could save
time over traditional assembly language programming.

PICs, MCUs and small hardware projects: some comments</H3>
I ignored PICs until a few weeks ago, when I found out about a small device
for radio control model sailplanes. It was PIC based and rather elegantly
conceived, simple and yet fulfilling all the design requirements within
various constraints. I took a look at the hardware, thought a little bit
about the firmware, and I was hooked.

<P>PICs will never replace the complex 32 or 64 bit processors that we
use in PCs. That's not what they were designed for! All the same, they
are very interesting devices, and I particularly appreciated the ease with
which one can reprogram the PIC16x84 EEPROM/Flash based devices. Compared
to the previous generations of 8 bit processors (I programmed in Z80 assembler
for quite some time) and also to the traditional MCUs, PICs really present
us with a new processor paradigm.

<P>What I found very interesting about PICs is that the CPU architecture
is strictly geared to the specific requirements imposed by the intended
uses: low power consumption, flexible bit handling, and a very simple programming
model. Basically, form (CPU architecture) follows function.

<P>Another feature of Microchip MCUs that I found particularly useful is
that developers are very well supported over the Web. The number and variety
of Application Notes found on the Microchip Web site is impressive, the
data sheets are easily accessible; but most importantly, there is a vast
amount of "unofficial" support.

<P>Besides, Microchip has setup over the years a vast distribution network.
Ordering a few parts from a well-known mail-order house was done in a few
minutes and cost &lt; $25, and two days later I was testing the devices
using my homemade programmer.

<P>Even though PICs are a commercial venture, developers have a very high
amount of freedom (in the GNU/GPL sense) to work on PIC based projects.

<P>Right now I am using freely distributable GNU/Linux based software for
development work, without any need to switch back to DOS. The GNU/Linux
tools can (and should) be improved, but right now they are perfectly functional:
with a few PIC parts (pic16c84 or pic16f84), a breadboard and a few passive
components, one has the ideal beginner's MCU development system. I hope
Microchip will understand the significance of a free development environment
and begin supporting GNU/Linux based tools someday.
