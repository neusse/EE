TODO
----

        - Debug/optimize the code generator.
        - Add adequate support for other assemblers besides picasm 1.06.
	- Re-implement 16-bit ints. Right now only (unsigned) 8-bit chars
are available for PICs. Very limiting sometimes...
        - Add a good set of I/O routines, for bit handling, etc...
        - Change function definitions from K&R to ANSI style.
	- Add some test code for the new EEPROM R/W routines.
        - Add support for other PIC family members besides the PIC16x84. This
basically involves writing different 12x/16x/17x/14000 .h files, which can
possibly be invoked using a compiler switch. A stack can be emulated in
software for those PIC MCUs with a small hardware stack. Microchip has an
Application Note explaining how to do this.
        - Improve the documentation. A man page would be welcome, as well as
some information about the compiler internal workings (I just got started on
that).
        - Your comments and suggestions are welcomed.
