HISTORY  - evolution of this Small C Compiler.
TODO	 - (lots of) things to do to improve this package.
README	 - usage information.

README_FIRST	- a warning message.

pasm.txt	- Parallax assembler and Microchip equivalent mnemonics.

pic_cc-0.3.lsm  - package description file for GNU/Linux archive

pic_tools.html	- links on freely available PIC tools.

/doc	 - a very humble attempt to document this compiler.

/src	 - the C source for the compiler, K&R original style.
	   Correctly compiles (with a few warnings) under gcc.

/orig    - The original Small C compiler for 8080, 6809, 68000 and VAX
	   (version 3.0 by Chris Lewis), Ken Yap's neat Z80 package,
	   and John Favata's pic_cc.

/tests	 - Small C code snippets that should compile OK to standard Microchip
	   PIC assembler code.

/pic_lib - various libraries:

/pic_lib/mlibpic.h - mult/div library (8 bits)
/pic_lib/slibpic.h - shift library (8 bits)
/pic_lib/glibpic.h - compare library (8 bits)

/pic_io  - i/o routines:

/pic_io/ee_read.c  - read a byte from EEPROM (16x84 only)
/pic_io/ee_write.c - write a byte to EEPROM (16x84 only)
