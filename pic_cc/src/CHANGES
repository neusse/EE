31/10/98	- begun working on John Favata's original source.
		- Converted filenames to lower case.
		- Ran most files through dos2unix.
		- Fixed file 16c84.h.
		- New Makefile.
		- code generator: jmp converted to goto.
		- code generator: ret converted to return.
		- assembler output file suffix is now .asm.
		- stack handling code in runtime file 16c84.h fixed.
		- code generator: putmem fixed.
		- code generator: getmem fixed.
		- code generator: used macro in 16c84.h to circumvent
immediate value loading problem.
		- picasm being a single-pass assembler, variables must
appear at the top of the compiler's output code. I added a file postproc.c
to handle this. The intermediate assembler output file has suffix .s, the
final file has suffix .asm.
		- Wow! File simple.c compiles to correct code that picasm
assembles without complaints!

01/11/98
		- code generator: ginc and gdec fixed.
		- code generator: gor, gand, gxor, gadd fixed.
		- code generator: gneg, glneg, gcom fixed.
		- code generator: getloc, modstk fixed.
		- Wow! File simple1.c compiles and assembles OK!

02/11/98
		- code generator: testjump fixed.
		- code generator: gaslint fixed.
		- code generator: gsub fixed.
		- mul and div (mlibpic.h) fixed. Changed the algorithms to
those in Microchip AN-617/AN-526. Note that mul is 8x8 bit, with 8-bit (LSB)
result...
		- new 16f84.h file.

03/11/98
		- arithmetic shift routines fixed (slibpic.h).
		- compare routines fixed (glibpic.h).

04/11/98
		- various tests. Package seems usable.

05/11/98
		- testing with nitpic (an X Window PIC simulator under
GNU/GPL). Found a file conversion utility from inhx8m to .pt (a special,
non-standard input file format used by nitpic). Found two small bugs in
nitpic and fixed them.

06-12/11/98
		- more testing with nitpic; fixed various buglets. The
compiler now correctly compiles all the test programs in /tests.
		- fixed main.c for correct handling of strings (see file
test6.c).
