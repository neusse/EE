This package contains the source code for the PIC-C compiler:

\source  directory contains the port of smallC to PIC16C84

\source\orig\ part1 part2 part3 are the original source code. 

The original source has been modified in various ways to generate
code for the PIC16C84. It is not the original smallc with a
new code generator. It can no longer compile itself..........


The files: 
\pic_rt\16c84.h 
\pic_rt\(MSG)libpic.h 
are run-time and library routines are are loaded as needed 


The files in:
\pic_lib
are various useful I/O type code for pics


/*********Compiling Compiler**********/

To compile PIC-C compiler: 
    compile all of the *.c files (except test.c) and link to pic_cc.exe

(warning: files may contain ^M character (DOS files), remove them
if you are using a UNIX system...ie. dos2unix)


/*********Using Compiler**************/

To compile c source <c_file.c> to pic code <output file: c_file.s>: 

   pic_cc c_file.c

Assemble code (make sure all of the \pic_rt files are in the current directory):

   pasmx c_file.s /L

Simulate code:

   psim c_file


(special thanks to Parallax for their PIC tools)


Try the compiler on the files\tests\test(0-7).c!



/*********NEW ADDITIONS***********/

Static strings are supported (great for nice LCD displays)
(see test files)


/*********THINGS TO DO************/

Nice compliment of library routines!


/*********BUG REPORTING***********/

If you find a bug in the output of the compiler:

	1) Verify carefully that it is a compiler bug... 8-)

	2) Find the smallest code fragment that produces the bug

	3) (optional) Try and fix the compiler yourself 

	4) email the bug report (and fix, if possible) to:
	   favata@cs.buffalo.edu


Happy PIC_CCing
